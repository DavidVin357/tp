# User Guide

## Introduction

Food Supply Tracker (FSP) is a desktop app for managing food supplies, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FSP can get your food management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
